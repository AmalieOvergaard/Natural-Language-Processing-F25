Github page containing all relevant material for my NLP exam

The NOW corpus used for this exam cannot be shared on a public page due to licensing restrictions, as access requires a paid subscription. Instead, the preprocessed csv file will be provided as appendix to the exam paper on Wiseflow. That way the KeyNMF script can be run.
